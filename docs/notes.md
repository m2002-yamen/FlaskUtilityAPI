\# Notes (Assignment 2)



\## Biggest Docker problem I faced

(Dockerfile was saved as Dockerfile.txt so Docker couldn't find it. I fixed it by renaming it to Dockerfile and rebuilding.)



\## Most important Git/GitHub lesson I learned

(I learned that you must set user.name and user.email before committing, and how to push a local repo to GitHub using remote + push.)
